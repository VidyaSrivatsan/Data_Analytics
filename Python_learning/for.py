# Store monthly expenses in a list and find out total expenses for all the months
# for loop should be used to perform operation for range of things.

# To break a for loop, use the following method:
# scenario: finding an key in a room and once found break the loop

#key_location = "room3"
#locations= ["room1", "room2", "room3", "room4"]
#for x in locations:
    #if x==key_location:
        #print("key is fouund in:", x)
        #break
    #else:
        #print("key is not found in:", x)

# continue statement
#Scenario: Print square root of odd numbers
#for i in range(1,6):
    #if i%2==0:
        #continue
    #print(i*i)

# while loop
i=1

# To print range of numbers, perform the following steps

#for x in range(1,10):
